numcomments
===========

This quick little script can be used to determine your comment to code ratio for C, C++, and Java files.
The idea is inspired by a course that I TA, Data Structures, where students are penalized if they do not
include enough comments with their code. This tool should be used to get an idea of your comment to code ratio,
but it does not check the validity or clarity of your comments, so if you are one of my students, DO NOT THINK
THAT QUANTITY OVER QUALITY for comments is ok ;-).
